# Defect Detection Tool Guide
This document will go through how to use the models get from [Object detection training guide](https://github.com/silicon-optronics-inc/Tensorflow2-Self-Training-Defect-Detection-With-Severity-Score/blob/master/object_detection/README.md) and [Classification training guide](https://github.com/silicon-optronics-inc/Tensorflow2-Self-Training-Defect-Detection-With-Severity-Score/blob/master/classification/README.md) to perform defect detection with severity score.
